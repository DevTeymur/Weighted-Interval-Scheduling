Always run scripts from the **parent folder**.

## ðŸŒ± Working on Your Own Branch
To avoid conflicts when contributing:  

1. **Log Files**  
   - Create your own log file, for example:  
     ```
     results_log_{your_name}.csv
     ```
   - Update the `log_results_csv` function in your code so it writes results to your personal log file only.  

2. **Online Algorithm**  
   - Create your own script for the online algorithm, for example:  
     ```
     online_{your_name}.py
     ```
   - Implement your version of the online code there.

## âœ… Summary
- Run scripts from the parent folder.  
- Keep your own log file (`results_log_{your_name}.csv`).  
- Write your online implementation in a new file (`online_{your_name}.py`).  
- This way, everyoneâ€™s results and code stay separate, and no conflicts happen.
